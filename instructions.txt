ASSIGNMENT: “Clone Your Future” - Bootstrap Portfolio 

This portfolio is your future brag sheet, the one you’ll be sliding into company inboxes and showing off on LinkedIn. Think of it like a Pokémon:

it evolves as you do. Every new skill you unlock, every project you build, every shiny feature you code, it all belongs here. Don’t let it gather dust. Keep feeding it fresh projects from this course (and the ones you’ll tackle later). The more you update it, the stronger it gets like turning your “student portfolio” into a “hire-me-now” machine.
