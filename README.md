## Sections

- **Hero Section** — Full-screen background image with a dark overlay, my name and role front and center, and a sticky navbar with anchor links.
- **About Me** — A card layout with my profile photo, contact details, skill badges, and a short bio about who I am as a developer.
- **Projects** — A responsive grid of 6 project cards (3 real clones + 3 additional projects), each with images, descriptions, and action buttons. The grid adapts from 3 columns on desktop to 1 on mobile.
- **Contact** — Social media icons, and a form with proper labels and HTML validation for accessibility.
- **Footer** — Clean dark footer with attribution text.

## Bonus Feature

- **Auto Dark Mode** — The site automatically switches between light and dark themes based on the user's operating system preference, using `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` and CSS custom properties.
